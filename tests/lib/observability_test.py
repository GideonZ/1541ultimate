# Gate check: the code that watches a gate run is itself correct.

"""Verify the observability harness, without a device.

Everything the observability design adds is code the gate's own verdicts
cannot exercise: a component there may not change a suite verdict, a health
verdict or the process exit status, so nothing notices when one of them
breaks. A defect here is not found by a failing gate. It is found weeks later
by somebody who opened an artifact to diagnose a firmware defect and found an
empty report, a black recording or a log with half its lines, by which time
the run is gone.

Four tiers, and every piece of logic belongs to exactly one:

    1 pure       functions over bytes and records: rendering, interval and
                 timecode arithmetic, ANSI stripping, datagram attribution
    2 component  one component against the device double over real sockets
    3 pipeline   a whole scripted run with no real device, producing a -j tree
                 with the current runner, then the report generated from it
    4 golden     the report generated from the checked-in fixture, compared
                 byte for byte with the checked-in expected document

Tier 3 is the one the others cannot replace: the report generator can be
perfect against a fixture the runner no longer writes. Tier 4 is the one that
makes a rendering change visible in review, because a diff of the expected
document is exactly the diff a reader of a real report would see.

Runs three ways, one implementation: `make observability_test`, the
`observability` entry in the `SUITES` registry in `run-tests`, and a step in
.github/workflows/build.yml. It reports through tests/lib/report.py like every
other registered suite rather than through unittest, because a registered
suite that printed unittest output would break the one rule
tests/lib/README.md says is not negotiable.
