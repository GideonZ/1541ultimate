Changes in 3.10i, compared to 3.10a
-----------------------------------

Background:
    If you would take some time to check the commit history of the repository
    at GitHub, you may find over 500 commits since the last released version, 3.10a.
    This is a lotttt more than it usually takes to release a next firmware version.
    The version is still 3.10, so there are not many functional changes. Yet, files
    have been touched, updated, or just made compatible with the new Ultimate-II+L
    hardware. It was more difficult than expected to get the Lattice FPGA to work
    correctly and keep compatibility with the existing hardware platforms.

    On top of the new introduction of the Ultimate-II+L, there is still a need to
    support the "good old" 1541 Ultimate-II (or simply: U2). There have always
    been issues with the Microblaze processor and the compiler from Xilinx. Every
    version of the Xilinx compiler had different bugs that caused the Microblaze
    based firmware to be broken in one way or another. Since the U2+L runs well
    on the Risc-V, it was decided to upgrade the CPU inside of the U2 and ditch
    the Microblaze forever. Unfortunately, the CPU that was chosen to run inside
    of the U2+L did not fit in the same space as the Microblaze clone, so I
    decided to write my own Risc-V compatible CPU. This is the CPU that will be
    used from now on in the 1541 Ultimate-II.

Fixes:
    [Important] Fixed ExFAT filesystems with 128kB clusters
                (Fixes failing D64 mounts from some ExFAT thumbdrives)
    [Facebook Discussion] EasyFlash save function now saves all chip chunks to
                support incomplete CRT files
    [Issue-271] GEORAM at boot (MarkusC64)
    [Issue-279] Support for 2 MHz operation for any cartridge, including EasyFlash
    Minor fixes in the modem emulation layer from Scott Hutter (xlar54)
    U64 only: Multicolor graphics side border bug (core version V1.41 => V1.42)

Additions:
    Firmware target added: Ultimate-II+L; the Lattice version!
    System Information page now shows elaborate version info.
    GEOS support functions from MarkusC64

Cartridge Support:
    [Issue-314] Added support for Blackbox V9.


Changes in 3.10a, compared to 3.10
----------------------------------

Fixes:
    [Issue-246] Fixed: Virtual Printer crashes when file cannot be created.
    [Issue-234] Deleting last item in directory makes selection invisible
    [Issue-236] Confirmation modal asking a question only gives 'OK' instead of 'Yes/No'.
    [Issue-R17] Added mapping of ESC key to RUN/STOP.
    [Facebook Request] Added: Leave menu on mount (can be selected per drive)
    [Facebook Bug Report]: Fixed starting Kingsoft Business Basic cartridge
    [Facebook Bug Report]: Allow Maverick (and others?) to write wrong sector headers on MFM tracks.
    [Facebook Bug Report]: Unable to select GeoRAM. Is now a mode of the RAM Expansion Unit.
    [Facebook Bug Report]: Fixed color palette not loaded at boot (U64 only).
    [Facebook Bug Report]: Fixed USB sticks not recognized
    [Messenger Report]: Improvements to palette file read. Rejects faulty files. Fixes hang-up
    [Messenger Report]: Fixes 'Create DNP' when run from Telnet. Turned out to be a stack overflow.
    [Email Discussion]: Adds EEPROM segment to GMOD2 when it is missing in the CRT file

U2:
    Fixes that U2 updater killed the flash before asking to update, leaving a semi-bricked device.
    Fixes drive sounds.

Modem:
    ACIA NMI pulse extension to extend over bad line. This allows the 6502 to see it always.
    Performance optimization ACIA / Modem
    Allow spaces after ATDT command.

Cartridge Support:
    Additional C128 cartridge variant that allows banking and offers some RAM (U2/U2+ only).

====================================================
